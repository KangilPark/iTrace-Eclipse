Building the Tobii library
=====

1. Download the Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 (http://www.tobii.com/
     eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/
     tobii-software-development-kit/tobii-software-development-kit/)
2. Extract the libraries to your library path and headers to your include path.
3. Install Boost 1.40. Required libraries include filesystem, system, regex,
     and thread.
4. Use the GNU C++ compiler (g++) to compile edu_ysu_itrace_TobiiTracker.cpp to
     libTobiiTracker.so/TobiiTracker.dll.

Compilation notes:
=====

- The result must be compiled to a shared library and must be linked against all
    dependencies (Boost and Tobii SDK).
- On Windows, include the flags "-D_JNI_IMPLEMENTATION_ -Wl,--kill-at" to the
    G++ compiler in MinGW.
