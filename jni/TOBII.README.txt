Building the Tobii library
=====

1. Download the Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 (http://www.tobii.com/
     eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/
     tobii-software-development-kit/tobii-software-development-kit/)
2. Extract the libraries to your library path and headers to your include path.
3. Install Boost 1.40. Required libraries include filesystem, system, regex,
     and thread.
4. Run CMake within the <project_root>/jni/ directory. Use make or mingw32-make
     to build the JNI library.
5. Copy the .so/.dll file created by make to the project root as
     libTobiiTracker.so on UNIX systems or TobiiTracker.dll on NT systems.

Compilation notes:
=====

- Currently only tested using the GNU C++ compiler under Ubuntu GNU/Linux and
     the MinGW environment under Windows 7.
